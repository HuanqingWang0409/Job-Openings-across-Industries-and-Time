# Job-Openings-across-Industries-and-Time
▪	This is a data analysis project when I worked as a data scientist intern at HireBeat. The report in .pdf format is "Job Openings across Industries and Time.pdf
".<br />
▪	Used **Tableau** to analyze data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics JOLTS database to quantitatively measure hiring demand. <br />
▪	Identified future hiring demand to be promising due to an increasing trend in the number of aggregate non-farm job openings. <br />
▪	Among the 19 non-farm industries, recommended two industries to the development department: **Health Care** and **Food Services**, so that 
they could develop the applicant tracking system suitable for businesses in these industries to maximize client demand.<br />
